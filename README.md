# Personal Portfolio
## 🚀 Overview
This is my personal portfolio website, built as a **full-stack project** using **TypeScript**. It showcases my skills, experience, and selected projects in a modern and visually engaging way

## 🎯 Purpose & Importance
- **Self-branding:** A single place to present who I am and what I build as a developer and data analyst.
- **Learning by doing:** Strengthened my TypeScript and React skills, while exploring full-stack architecture and deployment.
- **Open Source Contribution:** Created as part of **Hacktoberfest 2025**, encouraging collaboration and contributions from the developer community.
- **Design to Deployment:** I personally handled everything — **UI/UX design in Figma**, **frontend development (React + Tailwind CSS + TypeScript)**, **basic backend setup**, and **hosting**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js / Express (API for contact form & dynamic content)
- **Hosting:** [Your hosting platform — e.g., Vercel, Netlify, or Render]
